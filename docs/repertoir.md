# Repertoir

*Despite having a structure, all of these are still improvised.*

## Improvizační zápas (Improv match)

This form, inspired by [Theatresports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatresports), evolved in Czech environment as a platform to spread improv know how. It does not resemble classic theatre at all, instead it is more simillar to hockey match, where two teams meet on "ice" to fight in games. Each game has specific rules, overseen by Referees. Audience decides who is the winner by voting after each game.
Typically, we would just play [Theatresports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatresports) as defined by [the Big K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Johnstone), but environment in our country is not as willing to put money into culture.

## Příběhy z Motelu (Stories from the Motel)

Imagine American desert highway, something like [Route 50](https://www.google.cz/search?q=us+route+50&num=20&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib6Nigwq3dAhUQKBoKHbJlBrMQ_AUICigB&biw=950&bih=967). Somewhere in the middle, there is a Motel and in that Motel, there is a room. These are three isolated stories of people who visit this specific room once in a while. To make the whole show start, audience inputs one word as an inspiration for the whole evening.

## Úplně obyčejné zprávy (Entirely ordinary news)

Two actors, one table, many characters. Inspired by audience input defined before the show, these are lightning fast news from around the globe. Some of the news stories are extended into detail and become investigations.
